# Load_Forecasting_using_LSTM
We are doing short term load demand prediction using RCNN - LSTM and are trying to improve it's performance using a Nature Inspired Technique.
Along with the fast development of electricity power market, electricity power industries are getting into free com- petitive area. Therefore, short-term load demand prediction is becoming important in such power systems. However, electric- ity load forecasting is challenging. There are many influencing issues such as climate factors and social activities which cause the data to be highly nonlinear.
